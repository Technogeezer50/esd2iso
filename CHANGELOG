CHANGELOG

Version 1.0 - Initial release

Version 2.0 (15-Mar-2023)

	Enhanced error detection.
	
	Reduction of "chatty" output when the -v (verbose) option is not selected. 
	
	The -v (verbose) option now includes more information for use in debugging
	(and if you're really interested in what goes on under the hood).
	
	Addition of -V option to print the script version and exit.
	
	When using the -a option, the script will now retry an interrupted ESD download 
	up to 20 times before aborting the script. This should reduce the need to use the 
	-r option to restart interrupted ESD downloads due to network issues.
	
	Some internal changes for efficiency.
	
Version 2.1 (22-Mar-2023)

	Additional checks for required utilities. 
	
	Check if $PATH contains the Homebrew or MacPorts directores. Add them if
	they are present and are not on $PATH already.
	
	Examples now appear in the README file

Version 3.0 (19-May-2023)	

	Now released under GPLv2 license.

	Removal of manpage documentation from README file.
	
	Creation of manpage documentation in pdf format.
	
	Rename of utility from w11arm_esd2iso.sh to w11arm_esd2iso.

	Installation of aria2 and wimlib from Homebrew or MacPorts is no longer required. The
	necessary utilities that w11arm_esd2iso needs are now bundled with the distribution.

	Tests required for existence of Homebrew or MacPorts have been removed since they
	are no longer necessary. 

	Removal of -a option - aria2c is used for all downloads and restarts are
	automatically enabled.
