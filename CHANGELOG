CHANGELOG

Version 4.0.2 (13-July-2023)

	Version 4.0.2 fixes a bug where installation of an open-source version of 'tar' 
	through Homebrew or MacPorts caused a failure to extract the Windows 11 catalog of
	available downloads. This bug was caused by an open-source version of 'tar' being
	installed by Homebrew and found on the user's PATH variable before the macOS 
	installed version. Thie bug is fixed by invoking the 'tar' utility using its full 
	path instead of relying on it being found through the PATH variable.
	
Version 4.0.1 (03-July-2023)

	Version 4.0.1 adds verification of the SHA1 hash of the ESD download to the hash
	value provided by Microsoft. This will catch rare instances of a
	corrupted download.  

Version 4.0 (28-June-2023)

	Version 4.0 is now an interactive utility that makes it even easier to create the Windows
	11 ARM ISO.  
	
	THe utility now asks the user for the type of ISO to create (either Home/Pro or Pro/Enterprise)
	and asks the user to select the language of the ISO from a list of valid languages
	that it prints. It is no longer required to specify this information on the command line
	or to run another option of the utility to print out the valid Windows languages.

	As part of this change, the command line syntax is not compatible with versions 3.0.1
	and earlier. The following changes have been made to the command line syntax:
 
 	- The esd-language argument on the command line is no longer required and has been removed. 
 	  This is replaced by the interactive dialog within the utility.
 	  
 	- The -l option to list the available languages has been removed.
 	  This is now automatically done as part of the new interactive dialog.
 	  
 	- The -b option to specify the Pro/Enterprise ISO hs been removed.
 	  This is replaced by a question for the user to select the editions in the 
 	  new interactive dialog. 
 	  
	The -r option remains and is still used to resume an interrupted download.
	
	Version 4.0 recognizes if the wimlib or aria2 open-source utilities from Homebrew or 
	MacPorts are available via the users $PATH veriable, and will use them if they are found.
	If they aren't found, the bundled versions will be used. 
	
	The amount of disk required by the ISO build process has been reduced. 
	The downloaded ESD file is deleted immediately before step 4 (the creation of the 
	ISO from the installation image) as it is no longer needed at that point. This saves
	approximately 5 GB of disk space over versions 3.0.1 and earlier during the build 
	process. 
	 
	
Version 3.0.1 (21-May-2023)

	Version 3.0 would display macOS Gatekeeper errors such as "unidentified
	developer" and "unable to verify with Apple" which prevented the utility from running.
	These errors were displayed when the the utility tried to run any of the bundled open source
	components.
	The errors could be worked around, but would require multiple
	manual interventions by the user to allow w11arm_esd2iso to run.
	This has been fixed in 3.0.1, and no manual intevention by the user is required.

Version 3.0 (19-May-2023)	

	Now released under GPLv2 license.

	Removal of manpage documentation from README file.
	
	Creation of manpage documentation in pdf format.
	
	Rename of utility from w11arm_esd2iso.sh to w11arm_esd2iso.

	Installation of aria2 and wimlib from Homebrew or MacPorts is no longer required. The
	necessary utilities that w11arm_esd2iso needs are now bundled with the distribution.

	Tests required for existence of Homebrew or MacPorts have been removed since they
	are no longer necessary. 

	Removal of -a option - aria2c is used for all downloads and restarts are
	automatically enabled.
	
Version 2.1 (22-Mar-2023)

	Additional checks for required utilities. 
	
	Check if $PATH contains the Homebrew or MacPorts directores. Add them if
	they are present and are not on $PATH already.
	
	Examples now appear in the README file

Version 2.0 (15-Mar-2023)

	Enhanced error detection.
	
	Reduction of "chatty" output when the -v (verbose) option is not selected. 
	
	The -v (verbose) option now includes more information for use in debugging
	(and if you're really interested in what goes on under the hood).
	
	Addition of -V option to print the script version and exit.
	
	When using the -a option, the script will now retry an interrupted ESD download 
	up to 20 times before aborting the script. This should reduce the need to use the 
	-r option to restart interrupted ESD downloads due to network issues.
	
	Some internal changes for efficiency.
