CHANGELOG

Version 1.0 - Initial release

Version 2.0 (15-Mar-2023)

	Enhanced error detection.
	
	Reduction of "chatty" output when the -v (verbose) option is not selected. 
	
	The -v (verbose) option now includes more information for use in debugging
	(and if you're really interested in what goes on under the hood).
	
	Addition of -V option to print the script version and exit.
	
	When using the -a option, the script will now retry an interrupted ESD download 
	up to 20 times before aborting the script. This should reduce the need to use the 
	-r option to restart interrupted ESD downloads due to network issues.
	
	Some internal changes for efficiency.
