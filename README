README for w11arm_esd2iso 2.2 (22-Mar-2023)

This script is designed to create ISO installation media for Windows 11 ARM from 
ESD files in Microsoft's software distribution infrastructure.
This ISO can be used to install Windows 11 virtual machines on VMware Fusion 13 on 
Apple Silicon. 

This script will not be necessary when either Microsoft provides a Windows 11 ARM ISO 
for end-user download or VMware provides a way to create the ISO in their Fusion product 
like Parallels does.

Contents of the downloaded zip file:
