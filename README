README for w11arm_esd2iso 3.0.1  (19-May-2023)

SUMMARY

This utility is designed to create ISO installation media for Windows 11 ARM from 
ESD files in Microsoft's software distribution infrastructure.
The resulting ISO can be used to install Windows 11 ARM virtual machines on VMware 
Fusion 13 on Apple Silicon. 

This utility will not be necessary when either Microsoft provides a Windows 11 ARM ISO 
for end-user download or VMware provides a way to create the ISO in their Fusion product 
like Parallels does.

CHANGES IN V3.0.1

Version 3.0 would display macOS Gatekeeper errors such as "unidentified
developer" and "unable to verify with Apple" which prevented the utility from running.
These errors were displayed when the the utility tried to run any of the bundled open source
components.
The errors could be worked around, but would require multiple
manual interventions by the user to allow w11arm_esd2iso to run.
This has been fixed in 3.0.1, and no manual intevention by the user is required.

See the CHANGELOG document in the doc folder for changes made in prior versions.
