README for w11arm_esd2iso 4.0.2  (13-July-2023)

SUMMARY

This utility is designed to create ISO installation media for Windows 11 ARM from 
ESD files in Microsoft's software distribution infrastructure.
The resulting ISO can be used to install Windows 11 ARM virtual machines on VMware 
Fusion 13 on Apple Silicon. 

This utility will not be necessary when either Microsoft provides a Windows 11 ARM ISO 
for end-user download or VMware provides a way to create the ISO in their Fusion product 
like Parallels does.

CHANGES IN V4.0.2

	Version 4.0.2 fixes a bug where installation of an open-source version of 'tar' 
	through Homebrew or MacPorts caused a failure to extract the Windows 11 catalog of
	available downloads. This bug is fixed by explicitly invoking the 'tar' utility
	using its full path instead of relying on it being found through the PATH variable.
	
See the CHANGELOG document in the doc folder for changes made in prior versions.

EXAMPLES

Here is an example of the new process to build an en-us (US English) using the new
interactive features:

% ./w11arm_esd2iso   
[INFO] Bundled utilities are being used.

Do you want to create an ISO containing Windows 11 ARM Home/Professional editions
or Professional/Enterprise editions?

Enter 'h' to create a Home/Professional ISO
      'e' to create a Professional/Enterprise ISO
      'q' to quit: h

Windows 11 ARM Home/Professional ISO will be created.

Please wait while information is being downloaded from Microsoft for the Home/Professional ESDs
Processing complete


Please select a language for your Windows 11 ARM ISO.
