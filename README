README for w11arm_esd2iso 4.0.4  (2023-10-05)

SUMMARY

This utility is designed to create ISO installation media for Windows 11 ARM from 
ESD files in Microsoft's software distribution infrastructure.
The resulting ISO can be used to install Windows 11 ARM virtual machines on VMware 
Fusion 13 on Apple Silicon. 

This utility will not be necessary when either Microsoft provides a Windows 11 ARM ISO 
for end-user download or VMware provides a way to create the ISO in their Fusion product 
like Parallels does.
