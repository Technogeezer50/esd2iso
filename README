README for w11arm_esd2iso 3.0 (19-May-2023)

SUMMARY

This utility is designed to create ISO installation media for Windows 11 ARM from 
ESD files in Microsoft's software distribution infrastructure.
The resulting ISO can be used to install Windows 11 ARM virtual machines on VMware 
Fusion 13 on Apple Silicon. 

This utility will not be necessary when either Microsoft provides a Windows 11 ARM ISO 
for end-user download or VMware provides a way to create the ISO in their Fusion product 
like Parallels does.

CHANGES IN V3.0

w11arm_esd2iso is now released under the GNU General Public License. See the LEGAL
section of this README and the documents contained in the doc folder provided by 
the distribution.

Primary documentation for w11arm_esd2iso has been moved from this README file to 
the file w11arm_esd2iso_manpage.pdf, where it has been converted into a proper UNIX-style
man page. 

w11arm_esd2iso no longer requires the installation of open-source utilities
from Homebrew or MacPorts. All required components are now included with the utility.
Licensing notifications for open-source third-party components can be found in the
doc folder.

All downloads are now performed using the bundled aria2c utility. The behavior is the same
as if the -a option was specifified in prior versions.

The -a option has been deprecated and is no longer documented. If specified, a warning
will be issued and the option will be ignored. This was done to provide backward 
compatibility of the command syntax with earlier versions. 

Since aria2c is being used for all downloads, all interrupted downloads can be resumed
using the -r option.
